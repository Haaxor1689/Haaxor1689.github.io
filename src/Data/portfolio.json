In my free time I try to develop my skills in this field, ranging from coding to art development. I have an ongoing game project that I like to develop and expand, and try new ideas on. I like challenges that require creative thinking and solving them inspires and motivates me. I'm thorough and organized and hate shoddy quality work and that is what I want my work to reflect."
